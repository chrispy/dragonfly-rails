Adds model path scope customization to Dragonfly

Dragonfly store files using the current time, but for paperclip compatibility with this plugin you can make Dragonfly to save files on /model_table_name/:id_partition

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  set_df_scope 'avatars'
  image_accessor :df_avatar
end

User avatar files will be stored as /avatars/000/000/001/filename_original.jpg

class Image < ActiveRecord::Base
  image_accessor :df_image
end

Image files will be stored as /images/000/000/001/filename_original.jpg
